<h1>Hello curious crasher!</h1>

<p>You're seeing this page because the crash report you selected was held back
from submission. For statistical purposes, we don't need every crash report and
sometimes we decline the submission of a crash report as a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttling_process_%28computing%29">throttling</a>.
If you'd like to see your crash report, simply click on its link in
<a href="about:crashes">about:crashes</a> and your report will be automatically submitted to our server
where we'll give it priority processing.</p>

<p>Thank you for reporting your crashes.</p>
