Installation
------------

We provide documentation for setting up a complete Socorro instance :ref:`with a VM <vagrant-chapter>` or :ref:`locally on your system without a VM <local-installation>`.

Socorro provides :ref:`an RPM binary package <install_binary_package-chapter>` for easier installation with every release. For people working on modifying or contributing changes to Socorro code, you will also be interested in :ref:`installing from source <install_from_source-chapter>`.
