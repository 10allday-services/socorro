Socorro
=======

Socorro is a Mozilla-centric set of services for collecting, processing, and
displaying crash reports from clients using the `Breakpad libraries
<http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/>`_.


Support
=======

This is a very Mozilla-specific product. We do not currently have the capacity
to support external users.

If you are looking to use Socorro for your product, maybe you want to consider
alternatives:

* run your own: `electron/mini-breakpad-server
  <https://github.com/electron/mini-breakpad-server>`_
* run your own: `wk8/sentry_breakpad <https://github.com/wk8/sentry_breakpad>`_
* hosted/on-premise: `Backtrace <https://backtrace.io/>`_


Installation
============

Documentation about installing Socorro is available on ReadTheDocs:
`<https://socorro.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_


Releases
========

We use continuous development, so we release quite often. See our list of
releases:

Communication
=============

We have a mailing list for Socorro users that you can join here:
