    <h1 id="requestaccess">How to request memory dump and private data access</h1>
    <p>
        Anyone with access to memory dumps and private data agrees to the following:
    </p>
    <pre>* Crash dumps contain memory contents, and may contain private user data
* Only access dumps as necessary
* Keep data securely on Mozilla hardware
* When finished with a dump, delete it (within 30 days)
* Do not share personal data from the dump publicly (on bugzilla, irc, etc)
* Do not share personal data with non-employees, including partner organizations, without
  consultation and explicit permission from Lonnen (lonnen@mozilla.com); a signed NDA and
  other arrangements will be required of the other organization
* It is fine to share stack traces, analysis, and other non-personal data
* Access is conditional on employment and will be revoked upon departure from Mozilla
* Access will be removed after a year of inactivity</pre>
